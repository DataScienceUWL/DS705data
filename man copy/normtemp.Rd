\description{
The data for this problem comes from a dataset modelled after Mackowiak, P. A., Wasserman, S. S., and Levine, M. M.  (1992), "A Critical Appraisal of 98.6 Degrees F, the Upper Limit of the Normal Body Temperature, and Other Legacies of Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich," Journal of the American Medical Association, 268, 1578-1580.  Body temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) and heart rate (in beats per minute) were two variables that were measured for a random sample of 130 adults.
