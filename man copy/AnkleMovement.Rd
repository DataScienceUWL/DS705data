\description{
To reduce ankle injuries, restrictive appliances such as taping and spatting (applying tape over the shoe and sock) have been employed.  As part of a study at UW-L, subjects also completed a 5-point Likert-type scale survey regarding their perceptions of the movement of each ankle appliance during exercise.
