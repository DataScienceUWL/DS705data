WormSheep data set.

\description{An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment for tapeworm in the stomachs of sheep.  A random sample of 24 worm-infected lambs of approximately the same age was divided into two groups.  Twelve of the lambs were injected with the drug and the remaining twelve were left untreated.  After a 6-month period the lambs were slaughtered and the worm counts recorded.
