Row Times 
%%   ~~ data name/kind ... ~~
}
\description{Ninety members (aged = 18.1 – 23.4 years) of three Division I women’s intercollegiate rowing teams (National Collegiate Athletic Association) within the Big Ten Conference volunteered to participate in a study to predict race time for female collegiate rowers from physical characteristics.  Some of the measured characteristics have been omitted from this set.
